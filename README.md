This code is not to be understood on its own, as it is the code used to generate the plots and results seen in my master thesis. However, information about what is being done in the code is provided through annotations, in case anyone wants to check only the code. Moreover, the optimal way of visualizing the files is Preprocessing.R -> Computations.R -> Modelling.R. Many of these files generate .rds files that are used in the other code files, so the precious one is the optimal way to run the code in order to have all the .rds files when needed. The rds files themselves can' t be included in the github site due to excess weight file.
